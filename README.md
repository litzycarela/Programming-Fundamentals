# Programming-Fundamentals
Hello everyone! 

The purpose of this repository is to put everything I've been learning from my Programming Fundamentals class into one easy to find place.
The projects (although small for now) are helping me fully understand the basics so that I can move on to even more things.
All the files attached will be in Python since that is the language being used throughout the course.

I hope you enjoy looking at my work and if you have any suggestions or comments feel free to reach out at any time at: litzygabriellacarela@gmail.com or @litzycodes on Twitter!
